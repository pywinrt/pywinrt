# Py/WinRT

Py/WinRT is a tool for generating a Python projection of any Windows Runtime library. Py/WinRT is
designed to provide Python developers with first-class access to the modern Windows API.

Python developers looking to access WinRT APIs can simply install the `winrt-*` packages
from <https://pypi.org>. Py/WinRT is one of the tools that generated the code for these packages.
