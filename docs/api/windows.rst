===============================
:mod:`winrt.windows` namespace
===============================

The :mod:`winrt.windows` namespace package contains the automatically generate bindings
for the Windows SDK. Each WinRT namespace is distributed as a separate package
on PyPI. For example, the ``winrt-Windows.Foundation`` package contains the
bindings for the ``Windows.Foundation`` namespace and can be imported in Python
as ``import winrt.windows.foundation``.

Since most of the code is generated, there currently aren't Python API docs.
You can use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/ instead, keeping in mind
the Python naming conventions and other rules mentioned in :doc:`../types` section.

.. tip:: The packages include type hints so you can use those if
    you are unsure of a return type or a parameter type.

.. todo:: We could consider using https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/winrt-api to autogenerate Python docs.

Interop modules
---------------

There are also special ``interop`` modules that provide extra functionality
to bridge between WinRT and other interfaces.
